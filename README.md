This is a demo firmware for the Glove 2.0

   > The communication is now syncronous
      -> You need to send either "f;" or "r;" from unity to
         get the finger values or quaternions
   > The calibration is now done manually so that the
     Unity script doesn't time out. It seems that the lag had something
     to do with the timeouts, and now it's a lot faster.

This is an open source project, and all of the details are either on my
